# Image Encryptor Application

## Overview

This repository contains a Python application that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for encrypting and decrypting JPEG images using XOR-based encryption. The application is built with Tkinter and allows users to select image files, enter an encryption key, and perform encryption or decryption operations. It includes validation checks to ensure the images are processed correctly.

## Features

- **Encrypt Image**: Convert a JPEG image into an encrypted version using a specified numeric key.
- **Decrypt Image**: Convert an encrypted JPEG image back to its original form using the same key.
- **File Selection**: Easily choose image files through a file dialog.
- **Validation**: Check if an image is already encrypted or decrypted and provide appropriate feedback.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive GUI built with Tkinter for managing encryption and decryption operations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)
